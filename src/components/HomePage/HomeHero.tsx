        Report online frauds to help stop criminals, protect others, and improve
        cybercrime prevention. <br /> According to the FBIâ€™s Internet Crime
        Complaint Center (IC3), over 880,000 complaints were filed in 2023,
        <br /> with reported losses exceeding $12.5 billion. Yet, many cases go
        unreported, making it harder for law enforcement to act.
        <br /> Reporting strengthens investigations and helps raise public
        awareness.
